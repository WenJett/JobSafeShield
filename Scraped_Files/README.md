# This is the place where scraped files are stored for potential reference use. However, the files that are collated here are useless to the final project output and thus should not be used for any submission purposes. 

### Files Description 
**TF-IDF_Models:**
This file is scraped due to concerns over data leakage, where the implementation of tf-idf in the file may cause unexpected data leakage to the test set and thus lead to unexpected results. A new updated script has been implemented in place.

**NaiveBayes_WordProcessing_Models Files:**
These files are scraped based on the concerns that the naive bayes algorithm used to engineer features that are eventually fed into the models may lead to data leakage issues, similar to whats mentioned before

**CountVectorizer_WordProcessing Files:**
These files have similar data leakage issues as well. However, we do created another updated implementation that managed to achieve better results while mitigating the issues faced. 

**Rest of the files:** 
The other files are scripts that are designed for experiment purposes or to align and compile the research of all members.
